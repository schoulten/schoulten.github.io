Hi! Welcome to the repository that hosts and deploys my website: <https://fortietwo.com/>

You can find all information about me, my resume, portfolio, and some blog posts on my website.

"**_Why Fortie Two?_**"

It's a reference to Douglas Adams' book, *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, which I like and appropriated since my name is too common to get an interesting domain name.
